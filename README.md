## Tips on what we’re looking for

We value simplicity as an architectural virtue and as a development practice. Solutions should reflect the difficulty of the assigned task, and shouldn’t be overly complex. We prefer simple, well tested solutions over clever solutions. 

### DO

* ✅ Include unit tests
* ✅ Test both any client and logic
* ✅ Update the README.md with any relevant information and/or tradeoffs you would like to highlight

### DO NOT

* ❌ Submit a web, desktop, command line or any other kind of app
* ❌ Add unnecessary layers of abstraction
* ❌ Add unnecessary patterns/ architectural features that aren’t called for

# Begin the task

Create a shopping cart ***package*** that facilitates 2 basic capabilities.

1. Add a product to the cart
   1. Specifying the product name and quantity
   2. Use the product name to discover the price from the [Product API](#product-api) specified below
   3. Cart state (totals, etc.) must be available

2. Calculate the state:
   1. Cart subtotal (sum of price for all items)
   2. Tax payable (charged at 12.5% on the subtotal)
   3. Total payable (subtotal + tax)
   4. Totals should be rounded up where required

## Product API

Base URL: `https://equalexperts.github.io/`

View Product: `GET /backend-take-home-test-data/{product}.json`

Available products
* `cheerios`
* `cornflakes`
* `frosties`
* `shreddies`
* `weetabix`

## Example
The below is a sample with the correct values you can use to confirm your calculations

### Inputs
* Add 1 × cornflakes @ 2.52 each
* Add another 1 x cornflakes @2.52 each
* Add 1 × weetabix @ 9.98 each
  
### Results  
* Cart contains 2 x cornflakes
* Cart contains 1 x weetabix
* Subtotal = 15.02
* Tax = 1.88
* Total = 16.90
